<p>I am the Founder and Product Lead of a live video platform at NBC News. <a href="http://www.stringwire.com" target="_blank">Stringwire</a> crowdsources live video from eyewitnesses close to breaking news. The project began as my graduate thesis project at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" target="_blank">NYU's ITP</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I spent two years between South Africa and Kenya as a Product Manager at a mobile development studio building applications and games for campaigning and education. Before this, I worked for a leading European public policy think-tank; spent a year as a writer in Beijing; and once drove a Ford Fiesta from London to <a href="http://philgroman.com/wrongolia/index.html" target="_blank">Mongolia</a>.</p>
